There are 2 types of Databases :

1) Relational Database.
2) Non-Relational Database.

Let us explore more about these databases.


1) Relational Database :
                        In Relational Database, the data is stored in a structured format.
This structured format basically means that data is stored in the form of tables.
A table consists of rows and columns. These tables are related with each other.

2) Non-Relationoal Database :
                        A database system which does not store data in table format is called
  Non-Relational Database.  Unlike relational database, the data is not stored in rows and columns.
